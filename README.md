Welcome to the Numerical Methods Chapters Downloader.

Thanks to youtube's @numericalmethodsguy for making awesome video lectures and providing PDF of the notes on the website nm.mathforcollege.com.

This python script downloads all the chapters from the website, saving me somewhere around 2 mins 33s lol.


Requirements
1.  BeautifulSoup
2.  Wget
  
Help me make it better.

Coming Soon with a better documentation.
